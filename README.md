# Calculator

I've made this project during the Fundations path from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator">The Odin Project</a>.

Features :

- Basic calculator with JavaScript
- Operations history on the screen

Bonuses :

- Square function
- Change number of decimals and update the value displayed
- Keyboard support

What I've learned :

- Using JavaScript for math operations (without 'eval()' and security issues)
- More advanced manipulation of DOM
- Storing variables, accessing it to correct calculation
- Structuring and separating functions
